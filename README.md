# Obsidian Plugin for my blog site

This allows me to publish to my blog directly from my Obsidian vault.

This plugin doesn't really have functionality beyond my personal use case, although
the URL and auth is configurable so in theory, someone else could use it.

Moreso, it is available for anyone else as a reference plugin in case they want to make their own
